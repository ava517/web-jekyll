&lt;p&gt;Before working in the Executive Yuan, I also often encountered problems such as poor experience of government websites and low ease of use, such as poor mobile phone support, low logic of information architecture, lack of functionality, and non-compliance with universal design. Or, the font, typesetting, and color matching on the interface cannot meet the various and increasing needs of the people, and it also affects the mutual trust between the people and the government. 
In recent years, in order to provide a more consistent and smooth user experience, many governments and enterprises have begun to develop their own website design systems (Design System). What is a design system? It is just like a specification book for website planning. It not only defines principles and styles, including colors, layout or spacing, but also provides reusable components. FlatUI as shown in the figure below provides buttons, input boxes, and drop-downs. Elements such as menus, navigation bars, and progress bars; some are also standardized to interactive patterns to provide the best solutions in specific situations, such as forms, how to display error pages, and so on. Using the same interface structure can make different websites have consistent styles and designs, and adopting a similar logical information structure can effectively reduce the learning cost of users and make it easier for the public to use the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;https://image.cache.storm.mg/styles/smg-800xauto-er/s3/media/image/2021/12/03/20211203-045557_U20101_M730487_78ab.PNG?itok=ERFsxWE6&quot; alt=&quot;Components provided by FlatUI.&quot; title=&quot;Components provided by FlatUI.&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;http://[https://design-system.service.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;Design System&lt;/a&gt; launched by british gds, which is a very good example. when you click on the homepage, you can immediately feel its strong style. blue and black are the main color systems, and specifications and examples of various styles, components, and modes are provided. designers and developers only need to meet these conditions. can create a government website with “british government style.” this design system is widely used in other government websites, including &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;government homepage&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https: //data.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;open information platform&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&quot;https://coronavirus.data.gov.uk/&quot;&gt;epidemic information&lt;/a&gt; and so on. Although the functions of each website are different, they can still show the overall style, not only well-established Brand image, users are also easier to use the same design system website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The PDIS team in our office continues the previous work that RAY and young students jointly inspected and improved digital services on government websites The spirit, extending from a single point to a comprehensive, is now working with a new batch of interns to develop “Government Website Design System”. We hope to incorporate more elements that belong to Taiwan, and refer to common UI frameworks, and take stock of issues that easily cause confusion for users.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Adhering to the spirit of “starting from your own office”, this system will first be integrated with the PDIS website, and will continue to be adjusted and refined with designers and engineers to provide “convenience, peace of mind and effort” digital services. We look forward to the future design system can provide examples and specific and friendly suggestions to further improve the experience of government websites.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sean Chou</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Youth Engagement" /><summary type="html">Friendly examples and specific suggestions can further improve the experience of government websites.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/pencil-3744152.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/pencil-3744152.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Digital Democracy in Taiwan</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%9C%A8%E8%87%BA%E7%81%A3/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Digital Democracy in Taiwan" /><published>2021-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-12-01T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%9C%A8%E8%87%BA%E7%81%A3</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E6%B0%91%E4%B8%BB%E5%9C%A8%E8%87%BA%E7%81%A3/">&lt;p&gt;COVID-19 has stress-tested democracies across the world, and the results have left something to be desired. Many democracies, including those in the Indo-Pacific, have been revealed as flawed and failing – either grasping for authority or gasping for relevance. Is this really surprising, though, given that we have done so little to modernise these institutions that stretch back to ancient Athens?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan, by contrast, has shown us how we can strengthen and deepen democracy across the Indo-Pacific with citizen engagement. To ensure that democracies continue to flourish, we need to re-empower our populations and make our institutions fit for the world in which we live. In an Indo-Pacific where democracy is often said to be in backslide, we have an opportunity to reverse the trend to create a more open and democratic region.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s transformation to a digital democracy took place within a generation. Since World War II, the country has remade itself from a relatively simple agricultural society, with power concentrated in the hands of the ruling party, to a state characterised by social, cultural and political pluralism. Our first direct presidential election was held in 1996, right after the popularisation of the World Wide Web. In Taiwan, the internet and democracy evolved and spread in tandem.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2014, there was a definitive moment in Taiwan’s democratic invigoration: the birth of the Sunflower Movement. Half a million people took to the streets to protest the Cross-Strait Service Trade Agreement, an opaque trade deal with Beijing; millions more people supported them online as the movement fanned out across the country, and Taiwan’s parliament was occupied by citizens seeking to stop the progress of the legislation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the first few days, rumours and misinformation spread about what was occurring inside the besieged parliament. To ensure openness and transparency, I was there to help set up a system of communication, as were many from the decentralised “g0v community” (pronounced gov-zero), a group of civic hackers. The occupied area and the surrounding streets were connected in a local network, and a projector was set up outside parliament to show what was happening inside in real time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Sunflower Movement ended a little more than three weeks later, after the government promised greater legislative oversight of the trade pact. It was a successful public demonstration of a new version of governance, not only for Taiwan but also for the world, showing how a citizens’ assembly, assisted by professional facilitators and empowered by civic technologies, can lead to effective democratic action. Today, citizens in Taiwan understand that democracy – like any social technology – is enriched when people work together to improve society.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How can a government facilitate this? By harnessing the energy spread across sectors as a driving force for policy innovation, and by allowing the concept of “working with the people” to permeate public policymaking. In other words, by unleashing the power inherent in the “crowdsourcing” of democracy. When it comes to solving problems, a government should not look to formulate top-down policies, dictating paths to direct people to public services, but should instead build Public–Private–People partnerships that are guided directly by the needs of the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan continually implements programs to encourage these partnerships. The country’s Presidential Hackathon, now in its fourth year, invites citizens from around the world to propose open-data solutions to global issues that will create a more sustainable world – including ways to reduce energy use, to empower smart citizens and to promote investment in circular agriculture. The event is an opportunity for the social, public and private sectors to collaborate on digital innovations that link data across sectors in ways that resolve social problems. The winning teams are invited to participate in government initiatives, and the systems that they develop receive support from the public and/or private sectors, as appropriate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another democratic innovation, the one-stop participation platform join.gov.tw, enables members of the Taiwanese public to lodge petitions. Ministries hold face-to-face meetings twice a month to explore ways to incorporate petitions with more than 5000 signatures into policymaking, ensuring that everyone can help to set the agenda and feed into government decision-making. In fact, more than a quarter of citizens’ initiatives have been started by those under the age of eighteen – for example, the petition to ban plastic straws in Taiwan was created by a seventeen-year-old girl.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Cross-sector partnerships also play an important role in Taiwan’s success against COVID-19. In early 2020, when Taiwan was short on face masks and individuals were panic-buying, my government instituted a national rationing scheme. Anticipating that rationing would not stop runs on pharmacies, we also released an application programming interface to provide the public with real-time, location-specific data on mask availability. This led to the creation of the Mask Map, a series of interactive maps offering details about where masks are in stock and their numbers, created by social entrepreneurs working with the g0v community.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Similarly, early measures to record the contact information of those entering or leaving public venues led to the quick development and implementation of the 1922 SMS contact tracing system. The intuitive, app-free design by g0v is an easy way to check-in at public places while maintaining one’s privacy – anyone can register their phone number to see whether a contact tracer has accessed their data in the last twenty-eight days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since the early days of the internet, Taiwan has boasted a vibrant community of civic hackers and open-source programmers who engage with social issues – individuals who stand ready to further democratic endeavours and fight against authoritarian forces. Taiwan shows that, by trusting the people and by lowering barriers to democratic participation, we can create innovations that stand the test of time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The solution for the Indo-Pacific is simple: stop the rhetoric and start designing spaces for people to participate.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When faced with challenges that transcend state and national borders, people from different sectors must work together, step by step, to tackle them. I see Taiwan’s digital democracy as a sunflower, with those who contribute as petals. It blooms in Taiwan and stands tall as a vision for an inclusive and resilient Indo-Pacific.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Frances Feng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">Crowdsourcing for an Inclusive and Resilient Indo-Pacific.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/flower-field-gabaf6792c_1280.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/flower-field-gabaf6792c_1280.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Overturning the future, collectively</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E7%BE%A4%E7%9C%BE%E6%99%BA%E9%80%A0-%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%AB%E5%89%B5%E6%96%B0/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Overturning the future, collectively" /><published>2021-11-26T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-26T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E7%BE%A4%E7%9C%BE%E6%99%BA%E9%80%A0-%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%AB%E5%89%B5%E6%96%B0</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E7%BE%A4%E7%9C%BE%E6%99%BA%E9%80%A0-%E5%85%B1%E4%BA%AB%E5%89%B5%E6%96%B0/">&lt;p&gt;In the fall 2021 issue of “Stanford Social Innovation Review”, Professors Johanna Mair and Thomas Gegenhuber, both from Germany, stated that amidst severe challenges brought about by COVID-19, humankind needs a pragmatic, flexible and large-scale model for reinvigorating societal infrastructure. They highlighted the “need to experiment with social innovation based on collective action facilitated by digital technology.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wholeheartedly agree with and commend this message. In Taiwan, through collaboration between the social and public sectors, ideas and innovations have been sourced and implemented with concrete results. These include the SMS-based contact tracing system, 1922  vaccination appointment system and the 5000 Quintuple Stimulus Vouchers, all of which are social innovations resulting from collaboration with key stakeholders.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;British economist Dr. Geoff Mulgan once said that with the popularization of information technology, a civil society in a free and open environment, as well as the resources and wisdom brought together by energetic citizens, are the best opportunities to overturn the future. Whether it is an innovative and entrepreneurial organization, or the masses who use mobile phones to scan QR Codes, all can contribute to changing society. This is the best example of “collective intelligence.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the fourth anniversary of the Social Innovation Lab, the Small and Medium Enterprise Administration of the Ministry of Economic Affairs selected the theme “Collective Intelligence.” By incorporating the word “intelligence（智),” which is a homophone of “production（製）” in Mandarin, the term highlights the combined intelligence of collective actions breaking through the siloes in traditional departments, and co-creating effective and practical solutions to social problems via cross-discipline connections.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Encapsulating the spirit of “Collective Intelligence in Practice”, the anniversary celebration aims to create a hub where everyone can speak freely and channel creativity. For three days starting Nov. 26, in addition to physical activities such as workshops, real-world puzzle games and concerts, all lectures – including the experience sharing the Asia-Pacific Social Innovation Partnership Award, demo discussions of Taiwanese social innovation groups and discussing the government’s progress regarding the promotion of corporately responsible consumption – will be held physically and online.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the social innovation market and exhibition will break the time and space constraints for the first time and move to &lt;a href=&quot;https://gather.town/app/OpSG6nKGfIZ1MfCa/SDGS2021A&quot;&gt;Gather Town&lt;/a&gt; for 24 hours a day starting from Nov. 26. This approach reflects the phrase “reality is just another window.” Anyone can enter the booths at Gather Town, or switch to offline to go to the Social Innovation Lab at any time. Everyone can set their own space and create a unique reality. This is the core concept of shared reality.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Professors Mair and Gegenhuber said, shaping group actions through digital technology will take social innovation to the next level. The anniversary of the Taipei Social Innovation Lab, through a series of activities, crosses barriers and creates a space for physical and virtual integration. Started as a gathering site for Taiwan’s social innovation organizations, the lab will transform into a testing ground for globally minded innovators to gather and exchange. From Nov. 26 to 28, join us in the “Collective Intelligence” ecosphere.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">We need to experiment with social innovation based on collective action facilitated by digital technology.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/2111010247169917575720.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/2111010247169917575720.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Ministry of Education Youth Development Administration Website Revamp: Policy Co-creation Process</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/project/yda/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Ministry of Education Youth Development Administration Website Revamp: Policy Co-creation Process" /><published>2021-11-17T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-17T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/project/yda</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/project/yda/">&lt;h2 id=&quot;if-you-are-also-a-young-person-from-18-to-35-years-old&quot;&gt;If you are also a young person from 18 to 35 years old?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Youth Development Agency of the Ministry of Education (hereinafter referred to as the “Youth Agency”) provides a “Public Sector Internship Program” every year in order to strengthen the ability of college students to enter the workplace to help students understand the operation and organization of government departments through public sector internships The process of cultural and public policy formation encourages young people to gain first-hand experience through actual participation, unveil the mystery of entering the public sector, and create opportunities for future participation in public affairs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;it-just-so-happens-that-the-executive-yuan-public-digital-innovation-space-group-has-a-plan&quot;&gt;It just so happens that the Executive Yuan &quot;Public Digital Innovation Space Group&quot; has a plan…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the “Rescue Action by Youth” (Rescue Action by Youth), the goal of the project is to test the compatibility of government websites with Safari browsers. The members of RAY are all youth partners who are trainees in the public sector of the Youth Department. Join the Youth Department project and have a two-month virtual and physical internship experience in the Public Digital Innovation Space Group of the Executive Yuan.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Since then, RAY2.0 and 3.0 will be launched every summer vacation, and the website of RAY 4.0 will be renovated in 2020. We will continue to invite 30 students from different colleges and universities, including service design, interface design, visual design, and information. Engineering and other talents with diverse backgrounds cooperated with the National Development Council and related ministries to design and develop the &quot;prototype&quot; of the website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;the-youth-department-wanted-to-revamp-the-website-so&quot;&gt;The Youth Department wanted to revamp the website, so…&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because one of the students of RAY 4.0 in 2020, the website of the Youth Department was the target of improvement, and the prototype of the website was completed during the internship . Therefore, when the revision work started, the Youth Department invited the four RAY 4.0 students (Huang Caiyuan, Weng Xuanqi, Yang Bozhi, Luo Wanting) to jointly develop and design with the manufacturer, except for the use of the iterative process in the RAY 4.0 project. The “prototype” produced was incorporated into the interview results of the “User Needs Test”, and repeated design, communication, and testing were conducted with the manufacturer. After three months of full dialogue, the Youth Agency, RAY 4.0, the manufacturer, and PDIS joined forces. Efforts to complete the revision of the new website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h2 id=&quot;what-is-policy-co-creation-process&quot;&gt;What is Policy Co-creation Process?&lt;/h2&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Policy Co-creation Process aims to provide a transparent track record regarding the diverse collaboration and co-creation among all stakeholders, on public policy and service improvements corresponding to societal needs. It is not a static record but rather dynamic -– to increase public participation and distributed decision-making through a shared context.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Just like the production and sales history of agricultural products, through the combination of pictures and texts, and equipped with interactive games, forming a complete policy history. Through the participation of young people in the operation of the government, the practice of adopting young people's analysis and opinions, the promotion of government's digital services, the successful establishment of collaborative cases, the continuous fermentation of positive influence, and the classic model of government and youth cooperation.&lt;/p&gt;

With the active cooperation of the whole people, the number of confirmed cases in Taiwan has gradually decreased. With the stable arrival of vaccines, “70% of the first dose and 30% of the second dose” have successfully reached the standard at the end of October. After the vaccine was given, the people began to care: When will countries be able to open their borders and everyone can go abroad freely?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to shorten the time for entry isolation and quarantine, countries have begun to plan “vaccine passports” to post vaccination, inspection, or recovery records after illness, and also open a new mode of international exchange permits. The “Health Information Digital Certificate Issuing Platform”, which will be launched at the end of the year, is precisely to establish a credible vaccination certificate platform for people to use abroad.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there is no global common standard for “vaccine passport”, the entry regulations of different countries are not the same. Although the platform has been developed, there is still the last mile. It is necessary to conduct bilateral negotiations through diplomatic units one by one and obtain recognition from each country. .&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In order to save time and effort, as much as possible to synchronize with the international community, Taiwan’s first batch of digital certificates issued adopts the EU DCC standard launched by the European Union on July 1 this year and is used in conjunction with EU 27 countries and non-EU 16 countries. , Is currently the most common international standard.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Compared with the EU’s approach, Taiwan’s platform made two improvements:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First of all, in the EU usually a hospital or public agency makes the vaccination record. After the citizen applies, digital certificates are issued one by one. In Taiwan, the epidemic command center, combined with the existing NIIS system of the vaccination database, will complete the batch of records of the beaters and issue QR Code vouchers, which can be obtained upon application by the public, greatly shortening the waiting time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In addition, the platform does not need to install a dedicated App, you can download the digital certificate directly from the website, and show it or print it for use at any time. The verifier also adopts PWA (Progressive Web Application) technology, which is not only compatible with more devices, but also saves development and maintenance costs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the post-epidemic era, global cross-border flows are gradually recovering. For Taiwan, which takes international business and trade as its important economic lifeline and has a huge amount of overseas travel, holding a “digital vaccine passport” is undoubtedly the first step to reconnect with the world.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Mickey Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><summary type="html">Download the digital certificate directly from the website without having to install any apps.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/airplane-6674689.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/airplane-6674689.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Rescue action by youth speaks louder than words</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/Rescue-Action-by-Youth-speaks-louder-than-words/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Rescue action by youth speaks louder than words" /><published>2021-11-09T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-09T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/Rescue%20Action%20by%20Youth%20speaks%20louder%20than%20words</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/Rescue-Action-by-Youth-speaks-louder-than-words/">&lt;p&gt;On Double Seventh Day in 2021, also known as the Lunar Valentine’s Day, which falls on the seventh day of the seventh month on the lunar calendar, four young students from design, research and information backgrounds spent the night online. Instead of going on a date, they were immersed in lively discussions with Forestry Bureau technical specialist Mr. Che-wei Chuang on how to optimize the user experience on the Taiwan Forestry Recreation website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This episode took place in the fifth year of the Rescue Action by Youth (RAY 5.0), a project run by Public Digital Innovation Space (PDIS), an open government team led by Taiwan’s Digital Minister Audrey Tang. Fourteen college students from design, research and information backgrounds were recruited from a pool of 130 applicants to develop a website prototype over the summer to revamp what many would consider a “hostile” government digital service.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan had been hit by a surge of COVID-19 cases in May and physical meetings were still temporarily discouraged. These students, born in the Internet generation, were not new to digital tools such as Google Meet and Miro, and PDIS designed a set of online ice-breaking activities that allowed teammates who had never met each other to get acquainted quickly. Although there was less time for physical interaction, the students held online discussions together, conducted in-depth interviews with users, and worked in groups to redesign website prototypes for government services in a design thinking process. Each student devoted over 100 hours a month to this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The team responsible for redesigning the public childcare service registration system in Taipei City, for example, interviewed many new parents to understand their needs and the difficulties they encountered. The students, in the interview, were impressed by an account of a mother holding her child with one hand while trying out the registration system with the other, and made up their minds on the spot that they would make a mobile version that could be operated single-handedly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the past, civil servants were often unsure of how to design a service that would work well for the public because they “didn’t know how to identify user needs.” While members of the public often “feel” that government websites are difficult to use, these “feelings” do not know how to navigate through the bureaucratic maze to get input into the design process of government services. The RAY project builds bridges between the public and private sectors through the participation of young students, thus creating an opportunity for both sides to contribute and learn. “During the interviews, the students skillfully guided people to specify their real difficulties and needs, and it was only then that we realized what the users thought was quite distinct from what the civil servants had in mind, and that we are all so familiar with the service that it is difficult to see the blind spots in its practical use,” said Ms. Cheng, a social welfare department staff in Taoyuan City, whose volunteer recruitment platform system was also the target to be revamped by RAY 5.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This process also allowed the young students involved to appreciate the challenges posed to public service design: “Nothing is designed to be bad; instead of just picking on the flaws of a website, we should take a step further and ponder why the public sector is prone to these issues,” said Mr. Yang, a design major, adding that through collaboration with government departments, he and the civil servants were able to understand each other’s constraints and co-create a possible solution. Instead of empty talks, they were able to put ideas into practice, step by step.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/imgs/db940ae062d98d93188586d0176cbeb05757f688.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;discussing with government officials&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/imgs/b0aad09cf532f687b91b19d2c3e8499d5bd8d9a3.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;physical prototyping session&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2021, Taiwan launched its first Open Government National Action Plan (OGNAP). Part of its commitments under the OGNAP is to provide young people with a channel to participate in the formation of government policies and to achieve empowerment of the youth. The PDIS RAY project is continuously working on how to create better ways for young people to get involved in public affairs, not just by dishing out policy ideas, but by rolling up their sleeves and taking part in the operations of the public sector, thereby transforming government services bit by bit.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The challenge for PDIS is to ensure that students on short-term internships can integrate smoothly into government operations and make a real difference. In 2017, the first year of the RAY project, PDIS developed a mix of physical gatherings and remote online working formats, with no clocking in and out of work, no office space taken up, but no less enthusiastic collaboration. Both between students and with the public sector, the interactions went beyond mere work duties and had a deep emotional bond at the same time—there was never a shortage of hearty food and laughter at RAY project gatherings. This work style, which is a mixture of the real and the virtual, the rational and the emotional, proved even more resilient when COVID-19 struck.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/imgs/42abd100132483caa141158e8152478d7ad0261c.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;physical gathering with laughter&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/imgs/d86b9d26fdd6342a3cec409eed0ada602336803e.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;online work session with fun&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another important entry point for the RAY project is to collaborate on tasks that the public sector does not have time for on a daily basis. In recent years, the RAY project has been geared towards the introduction of “user-centered” service design, which marks a starting point for smart government to create mutual trust and collaboration between the public and private sectors. While government employees are well aware of this, they often do not know how to get started and are often distracted by their busy schedules. The RAY project has come up with a design thinking-inspired internship process that allows students to be on the front line, interviewing users in the company of civil servants, testing and fine-tuning their design, and eventually creating a website prototype and related content for public servants to refer to and use. In other words, the work of students under the RAY project saves civil servants’ efforts, and their output puts the latter at ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Open government is a core concept that runs through the whole project. In addition to the involvement of multiple parties, PDIS has been documenting the entire process in text and video since the first year, and has released it online under a Creative Commons (CC) license for public access, with the aim of encouraging other government departments to replicate this workflow. The Youth Development Administration’s (YDA) “Public Sector Internship Program for College Students,” which provides financial support, has become in high demand recently, with many agencies competing for places, and as a result, PDIS has reduced the quota for students this year and offered the vacancies to other agencies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The RAY 5.0 final presentation was delivered on the last day of August. PDIS invited senior government officials to attend the event where four groups of students showcased the outcome of their two months of in-depth research. Several government officials in attendance, including Minister Audrey Tang, had the opportunity to access their high-fidelity prototypes directly on the computer. Deputy Director Lin of the Forestry Bureau said happily, “This is what we wanted!” She then instructed her staff to initiate the procurement procedures forthwith, and these students, who had little business experience, could not hide their excitement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is not the first time that a similar situation has occurred with the RAY project. RAY 1.0 offered a comprehensive review of government websites to ensure that the user experience was the same across browsers. RAY 2.0 made it possible for government websites to have the same convenience on mobile phones, and less than six months after the project was concluded, almost all government websites no longer ran into similar problems.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In RAY 3.0, a specific website or system was selected to improve its interface or service process based on the needs of the public. The “Taiwan One-Stop Mountaineering Application Service” (https://hike.taiwan.gov.tw/), which integrates various online applications for national parks, nature reserves and mountain huts and campsites, is a representative example of RAY 3.0.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the beginning of 2021, the YDA partnered directly with the RAY 4.0 youth team on the “2021 Youth Development Administration Website Revamp,” using the RAY 4.0 team’s user experience analysis and report as the overall goal of the whole website design and revamp (https://www.yda.gov.tw/), which stood out as the best example of collaboration between ministries, youths and suppliers to create a new website.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In other words, youth participation should never be a one-way experience. What matters most to PDIS is whether youth engagement can make a real difference. Only by leaving useful results behind in the public sector in every cooperation will they be able to motivate enthusiastic young people to keep getting involved every year, so that more government departments will welcome more young people with open arms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The key to a smooth people-public-private partnership in the RAY project is to talk the talk and walk the walk. It goes straight to the heart of the matter, explores the needs of the users, forms a complementary role to that of the civil service, and finally produces a prototype that can eventually be put into practice. To put it another way, the RAY project not only brings the needs of the people to the public sector, but also regards the civil servants as users, and even in the case of administrative services, with the same user-centered design thinking, seeks to operate in an environment that is acceptable to all parties, with tangible results that allow the public sector to take over the next steps with minimal burden.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The collaborative model developed in the RAY project provides a concrete reference for government agencies to engage young people, and allows multiple stakeholders to find a foothold in open government through practical collaboration.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/imgs/2753ee3f62cbd8d28498d30fda4edc5749be5df1.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;students cocreating with the government officials&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src=&quot;/assets/imgs/5f33b2c397fac9d5e453ee68d99d70baf154dc23.jpeg&quot; alt=&quot;testing and prototyping&quot; /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Minister Audrey Tang said, “Open government is about transforming the government from ‘for the people’ to ‘with the people,’ and even to ‘after the people.’” RAY is a small-scale pilot project, but can give definite answers to the questions that must be answered in order to build people-public-private partnerships today.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;First, how do we keep youth or civic engagement motivated? The experience of the RAY project shows that engagement does not need to set ambitious goals, but to bring about real change, and that the cumulative results of cases will be a source of sustained participation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Second, how do we get government agencies to accept youth or citizen participation? The experience of the RAY project indicates that it does not require civil servants to change their working style overnight, nor does it try to impose an extra burden on the public service; instead, it identifies areas that government agencies want to work on but are not familiar with for collaboration, raises problems and solves them together to gradually foster mutual trust and reliance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Also, how can youth/civic engagement be maintained during the pandemic? Online tools can overcome the space and time constraints of multi-party participation, and the pandemic has given people extra impetus to access online tools. But it must be a welcoming online engagement, where the user’s feelings are not neglected and where the interaction between the virtual and the real environment allows the participants to become more involved. The experimental model of work initiated by RAY five years ago has proved its resilience during the pandemic and is expected to become the new norm in the post-pandemic era.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ultimate expectation of the RAY project, a cabinet-level youth engagement initiative, is that it can be replicated and scaled up in the public sector and government agencies. Through the participation of young people and their expert knowledge to understand each other’s experiences and difficulties, the expectation that public services are “supplied by the government to the people” will be shifted to that “services can be created by the people and the government together,” thus forming an inclusive public service. The RAY project exemplifies a new model of partnership building under Sustainable Development Goal 17, “Partnership for the Goals: Strengthen the means of implementation and revitalize the global partnership for sustainable development.”&lt;/p&gt;

In many countries we have seen the spread of misinformation, rising public anxiety and increasing political polarisation — often inflamed by social media. The challenge of tackling the virus, and the social problems it has caused, is straining the capabilities of governments around the world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In Taiwan, however, we see a silver lining in the dark clouds. The pandemic has strengthened our model of collaboration between people, government and the private sector, deepening what I call “people-public-private” partnerships. This is because we have built digital infrastructure that lets people freely express opinions on policy reforms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Our contact-tracing system, 1922 SMS, is a case in point. It was a solution jointly proposed by civictech communities in Taiwan to ensure both privacy protection and efficient contact-tracing. When Taiwan encountered its first wave of COVID-19 infections in May 2021, the g0v community (spelt with a zero in place of the “o”, and pronounced “gov-zero”), a decentralised group of “civic hackers” in Taiwan, swung into action. Civic technologists enthusiastically discussed how to improve existing registration systems, which mostly relied on paper and pencil, or primitive web forms, and were often confusing or counter-productive to virus suppression measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Inspired by these discussions, we worked with Taiwan’s five main telecoms firms to develop 1922 SMS. By scanning a QR code using a smartphone camera and sending a text message to the toll-free number 1922, check-in records are created and stored—with no need for an app. When necessary, contact-tracers can retrieve data from the system for quick and effective tracing. From discussion to deployment, the 1922 SMS system was built in a week. This would not have been possible without a robust partnership between the public and private sectors and the people.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is just one recent example of Taiwan’s alliance between public servants and civic-techies. Since its establishment in 2012, the g0v community has gradually grown into one of the largest open-source civic-tech communities in the world. In 2017, g0v established a system of grants to reward community proposals that can potentially benefit the public interest. This in turn inspired us to initiate an annual “presidential hackathon” event in 2018, in which civic technologists and public servants form teams and compete to develop innovative ways to upgrade government services.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For instance, in 2019 a group of engineers, designers and NGO advocates noticed limitations in the government’s open-data platform, data.gov.tw. As part of the presidential hackathon, they formed a team called Gov Data Opener and worked with the relevant government agency, the National Development Council, to make it easier to track the progress of information requests. In 2020 a team made up of landscape and geospatial-data experts, called Patch by Planting, proposed a scheme to identify urban areas where trees could be planted, using satellite data to map land use and tree distribution.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Another scheme, the Rescue Action by Youth (RAY) project, offers opportunities to students. Since 2017 my office has gathered RAY students every summer to review government digital services. The students are divided into groups to focus on upgrading particular departmental websites. Through design and usability studies, they create prototypes that showcase suggested improvements. This approach has been used to upgrade the websites of the Hike Smart Taiwan service, which is used by mountaineers and hikers, and the Youth Development Administration, among others.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are many other examples. An open platform called vTaiwan, created by volunteers, brings together representatives from the public, private and social sectors to devise and debate policy solutions to problems related to the digital
economy, from online alcohol sales to ride-hailing. A related government-maintained platform, called Join, hosts debates and helps create consensus in other policy areas. Since its launch in 2015, Join has been accessed by almost half of Taiwan’s population.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Democracy—the combination of demos (people) and kratos (rule)—means “rule by the people”.  The “Taiwan model” demonstrates how the use of digital platforms can strengthen democracy, by giving everyone a voice and enabling a government that works not just &lt;em&gt;for&lt;/em&gt; the people but &lt;em&gt;with&lt;/em&gt; the people.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><category term="Youth Engagement" /><summary type="html">The &quot;Taiwan Model&quot; shows the world the value of classical democracy in the digital age.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/acropolis-12044.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/acropolis-12044.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">World in 2022: Digital allies will unite</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%B1%95%E6%9C%9B-2022-%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E7%9B%9F%E5%8F%8B-%E6%8C%BA%E8%BA%AB%E8%80%8C%E5%87%BA/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="World in 2022: Digital allies will unite" /><published>2021-11-06T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-11-06T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%B1%95%E6%9C%9B-2022-%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E7%9B%9F%E5%8F%8B-%E6%8C%BA%E8%BA%AB%E8%80%8C%E5%87%BA</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E5%B1%95%E6%9C%9B-2022-%E6%95%B8%E4%BD%8D%E7%9B%9F%E5%8F%8B-%E6%8C%BA%E8%BA%AB%E8%80%8C%E5%87%BA/">&lt;p&gt;The Covid-19 pandemic wreaked havoc around the globe in 2020 and 2021. The coronavirus is likely to follow us well into 2022. People around the globe will keep looking for effective ways to cope with the shared challenges we experience that transcend physical boundaries. Although it might seem frightening that borders no longer provide the kind of protection we need to keep us safe in the physical world, we will see an explosion of opportunities in the digital world – opportunities relating to the formation of a global neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the erosion of the traditional concepts of countries, nations and states accelerates in the digital world, the idea of “neighborhoods” based on shared values is flourishing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We have already seen examples in 2020 and 2021, such as the #MilkTeaAlliance. This is a collaboration of pro-democracy citizens that originated from a meme depicting many jurisdictions around east Asia holding up their respective “popular drinks” (such as Taiwanese bubble tea) in solidarity. 2022 will see continued evolution toward a generation where distance is no longer measured in meters, but rather in terms of the experiences one shares in common with other people and groups.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Global neighborhoods will also bring changes to the way norms are established. Indeed, we will find ourselves in a world where the establishment of norms is no longer monopolized by governments and multilateral organizations. Decentralized, non-political and non-state actors will play critical roles in this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taiwan’s digital democracy can be seen as a precursor in this regard. On the country’s online platform, join.gov.tw, anyone can file a petition. There is no need to be affiliated with any political party. Twice a month, for petitions that gather 5,000 signatures, we hold face-to-face collaborative meetings across related ministries to explore ways to incorporate them into policymaking. In this way, even those who are too young to vote can nevertheless have a way to start a movement and set a norm.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Technology will be used even more widely to facilitate crowdsourced policymaking. Governance models based on what I call “People-Public-Private Partnerships” are set to be the key to government transformation. The creation of Taiwan’s Mask Maps showed people early on in the pandemic where masks were available in stores. Meanwhile, SMS-based contact tracing and online vaccination-appointment systems resulted from collaboration incorporating open data from social-sector platforms, government departments and private-sector companies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;With the rediscovery of civic infrastructures on the internet, civic technologists will unify opinions that are currently dispersed throughout society and transform them into a motivational force for creative policies. This will be even more important as we understand the need for our social, political and economic strategies to adapt frequently in response to ever-mutating viruses. An alliance forged between the government, the social sector and the private sector will thus be in place to meet the diverse needs of the populace in the shortest possible time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, we will see a continued emphasis on “swift and safe” technologies to bring about such broad participation. Cyber attacks and disinformation will continue to threaten democracies worldwide, but Taiwan will continue to share its experiences in adopting the tactics of “fast, fair and fun” in the fight against the pandemic and infodemic. Allies of the same mind will step up and work together to build a resilient global neighborhood.&lt;/p&gt;

From the start, it was affected by the rising pandemic. As an important collaboration platform for the government and citizens, the team flexibly adapted and modified the participation approach: the first workshop was fully remote, and the second workshop was held using the concept of “Shared Reality”, so there was no interruption due to the pandemic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even though the pandemic has now eased, in my opinion, the experience and results of this integration of virtual and physical realities are still worthy of your reference.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The first and second Presidential Hackathon workshops all followed the traditional hackathon process. All people gathered and were divided into teams to post ideas and discussions at the same physical location. The reviewers listened to briefings from and provided consultation to each team at a fixed time. After the outbreak of the global pandemic in 2020, the third annual workshop arranged each team in an independent space, and the briefings and consultations with the reviewers were also changed to video conferencing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year’s experience has made us realize that although the fully online approach can effectively reduce contact and ensure the effectiveness of pandemic prevention, it is difficult to ignite the sparks inspired by physical exchanges. The constrains due to participation and connection quality at a fixed time are no less than those in a physical field. On the other hand, the traditional fully physical approach not only has pandemic prevention concerns, but also has various physical limitations such as mutual noise interference from each table, lack of clear visibility during briefing, etc.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In view of this, this year, with the assistance of the “jothon.g0v” team, we adopted a hybrid model. In addition to the presentations and discussions in the physical space, the team also created an exclusive hackathon hall on the online platform Gather Town, and reviewers and teams all have virtual avatars. If a team needed additional help during physical discussions, or if they could not find local experts to discuss, they could go online as a group at any time. When they reached a stage through discussions in the virtual space and wanted to show the preliminary results, they could also gather together physically at any time.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As a result, the problem analysis of each team this year is indeed more insightful. It not only “explains the problem”, such as which open data lacks integration, but also further “solves the problem” through collaboration to find specific solutions for users to participate in data governance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The main theme of the Presidential Hackathon is to leverage inputs of the citizen community to spur new ideas in the face of existing problems and ultimately form concrete plans to enhance the effectiveness of public services. In my opinion, in addition to the impressive results of the participating teams, in the Presidential Hackathon this year, the collaboration process itself put forward a pioneering demonstration of the integration of virtual and physical work models.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I think the true spirit of “shared reality” is to allow everyone to transcend physical and time constraints and combine virtual and physical realities to create a space suitable for each other. Only in this way can we fully experience the feeling of being present together, and then create the future together to become an autonomous and interconnected “Multiverse”.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Mickey Peng, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Open Government" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">The true spirit of &quot;Shared Reality&quot; is to allow everyone to transcend physical and time constraints.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/20211105.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/20211105.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry><entry><title type="html">Sustainability and development: Great bedfellows</title><link href="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/ESG-%E6%B0%B8%E7%BA%8C%E8%88%87%E5%BD%B1%E9%9F%BF%E5%8A%9B%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%87/" rel="alternate" type="text/html" title="Sustainability and development: Great bedfellows" /><published>2021-10-29T00:00:00+00:00</published><updated>2021-10-29T00:00:00+00:00</updated><id>https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/ESG-%E6%B0%B8%E7%BA%8C%E8%88%87%E5%BD%B1%E9%9F%BF%E5%8A%9B%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%87</id><content type="html" xml:base="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/ESG-%E6%B0%B8%E7%BA%8C%E8%88%87%E5%BD%B1%E9%9F%BF%E5%8A%9B%E6%8A%95%E8%B3%87/">&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/blog/%E7%96%AB%E5%BE%8C%E6%8C%AF%E8%88%88-%E4%BA%BA%E4%BA%BA%E6%9C%89%E3%84%97%E3%84%9C%CB%8A/&quot;&gt;In my last column&lt;/a&gt;, I introduced the “Quintuple Stimulus Voucher.” By the end of October, the total number of paper and digital vouchers issued exceeded 19 million. Now that pandemic control measures are gradually easing, shops around Taiwan are filled with customers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the same time as spurring consumption, we are working out how to transform the turbulence brought about by the pandemic into a new impetus to shepherding the economy towards sustainability. One solution shown to work in Taiwan, which combines industrial innovation and sustainable development, is the rapidly developing ESG and impact investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ESG means incorporating “environment,” “social responsibility” and “corporate governance” into an evaluation criteria ensuring business operations have a positive impact on society and individuals. Over the past decade, ESG has become an indispensable part of corporate development. In 2020, the Taiwan Financial Supervisory Commission built upon this foundation in successively promoting the “Corporate Governance 3.0-Sustainable Development Roadmap” and “Green Finance Action Plan 2.0” to accelerate the sustainable development of Taiwan industry from the perspective of corporate governance and financial investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The measures adopted by the roadmap include renaming the current corporate social responsibility report to “Sustainability Report or ESG Report,” promoting the publication of all reports in English and strengthening third-party certification from 2023 onwards. In addition to the existing food, chemical, finance and insurance industries, as well as listed companies with capital exceeding NT$5 billion (US$179.9 million), all listed companies with capital exceeding NT$2 billion will need to produce a sustainability report.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plan, which expands the development of green financial products and services, is an important step taken by Taiwan to promote ESG. In May 2021, the Taiwan OTC Buying Center established a special board for the “Sustainable Development Bond” system. In conjunction, Taiwan’s first batch of socially responsible bonds were issued and listed on the OTC. Social performance and ESG information revealed that all public equity banks will issue green/social responsibility/sustainable development bonds within four years.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Through ESG, more and more Taiwan companies have become the new force of sustainable development. At the same time, the challenges are ever increasing. From coronavirus and climate change to the mental health of the younger generations, the world’s major risks include a variety of environmental and social issues.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year marks the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) 51st anniversary, and its theme “&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.weforum.org/great-reset/&quot;&gt;The Great Reset&lt;/a&gt;” indicates the gathering of stakeholders and cross-domain cooperation to establish “stakeholder capitalism.” It is heartening that via the efforts of Taiwan’s public sector and participants from all walks of life, the rapid rise of the ESG concept in recent years is one of the acts bringing industry and stakeholders together.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One example is the “&lt;a href=&quot;https://sert.tw/&quot;&gt;Social Enterprise Revolving Trust&lt;/a&gt;” (SERT) initiated by Taiwan’s private sector. SERT boasts a value of NT$200 million, and is Taiwan’s first charitable trust to invest in social enterprises. It also helps social entrepreneurs obtain seed capital for entrepreneurship. In the past five years, SERT’s total investment and sponsorship has surpassed NT$15 million. In addition, it has made equity investments in five social enterprises (SEs) and has supported numerous social innovators through sponsorships, action projects and scholarship programs.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;During this process, SERT has observed that SEs often have additional communication costs due to gaps in social missions, as well as the perception of company operations whilst facing market pressures. This year, SERT and its strategic partner KPMG have jointly designed the “Social Impact Preferred Stock (SIPS).”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The investment mechanism of SIPS aims to utilize the ability of “special stocks” to negotiate investment conditions. Furthermore, in order to secure the active participation of stakeholders, the company’s articles of association lock in its social objective and add an influence item to the board meeting agenda so as to assure the tracking of the social mission’s achievement. In July, SERT successfully launched its first “Social Impact Special Unit” investment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As the saying goes: “If you are not a part of the solution, you are a part of the problem.” Through ESG and impact investment, Taiwan is getting to the heart of the matter in charting a new post-pandemic course through which sustainability and development play an equally important role.&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name>Audrey Tang, Sheau-Tyng Peng</name></author><category term="blog" /><category term="Social Innovation" /><summary type="html">Through ESG and impact investment, Taiwan is getting to the heart of the matter in charting a new post-pandemic course.</summary><media:thumbnail xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/money-2696219_1280.jpg" /><media:content medium="image" url="https://pdis.nat.gov.tw/en/assets/imgs/money-2696219_1280.jpg" xmlns:media="http://search.yahoo.com/mrss/" /></entry></feed>
